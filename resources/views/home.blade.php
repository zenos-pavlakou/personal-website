				<h1 class="mb-3">About me</h1>
				<p>
					Hi there! I'm Zenos Pavlakou, a passionate programmer who enjoys taking on new challenges and solving complex problems. I found my passion for programming during my time at university and I have been captivated ever since.<br><br>

					What I enjoy most about programming is the way it allows me to turn my ideas into reality. One example of this is <a href="https://cryptomultisender.com" target="_blank">Crypto Multisender</a> which I built from the ground up. Since its release, the platform has been used regularly by various startup companies and the total value of all crypto assets processed by the platform exceeds $30,000,000.<br><br>

					I was able to achieve this because I believe that with the right tools and mindset, anything is possible. That's why I approach every project with a can-do attitude and a willingness to learn and adapt as needed. Whether I'm working on a small-scale project or a large-scale application, I take pride in my attention to detail and my commitment to delivering high-quality work.<br>

					<!-- In short, I'm a dedicated and enthusiastic programmer who is always ready to take on new challenges and push the boundaries of what's possible. If you're looking for someone who is driven, creative, and committed to excellence, I would love to hear from you! -->

						<p>
							As a student at university, I worked as a freelance developer on Fiverr, specializing in developing smart contract applications on Ethereum and other EVM blockchains. I offered services such as developing <a href='https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/' target='_blank'>ERC20 tokens</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering' target='_blank'>ICO smart contracts</a>, and <a href='https://cryptomultisender.com/blog/our-airdrop-smart-contract' target='_blank'>airdrop smart contracts</a>.

While balancing my studies with work, I continuously updated my knowledge of the latest blockchain technologies and best practices to provide cutting-edge solutions to my clients. My experience as a freelance developer on Fiverr has provided me with a strong foundation in developing smart contract applications, project management skills, and a track record of delivering high-quality work to clients.

						<p>
							During my time working as a freelancer on Fiverr, I noticed that there was a high demand for the development of custom airdrop smart contracts to enable the distribution of ERC20 tokens to thousands of recipients. This observation led me to develop Crypto Multisender, a tool that is capable of distributing all ERC20 tokens and NFTs. The development of Crypto Multisender not only demonstrated my ability to identify opportunities in the market but also my proficiency in creating solutions that meet the needs of users.
